# unidays-tech-placements-19-20
This is my solution to the problem posed by UNiDAYS over at https://github.com/MyUNiDAYS/tech-placements-19-20

# Approach
The way I approached this challenge was to first read the problem that was proposed and learn it.  
I then opened up a new Visual Studio project and typed away. The working prototype was done in three or so hours. I made sure to make use of an agile and object-oriented approach since that is what I'm most familiar with and I thought that it would be most suitable for a project like this one.

Of course, I don't know *everything* inside-out, so I referred to the official [Microsoft Docs for .NET API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/index?view=netframework-4.7.2) when I wasn't sure about how to use that specific method for that particular `List` type. I also made sure to always refer to the problem specification when I wasn't sure about a detail. I didn't use Git for this project since I've written the solution in one sitting, but it would have been a good opportunity to showcase my skills with Git and GitHub.

# Running the code
The solution is coded in C#, so it can be compiled using Visual Studio 2017. There is also a pre-compiled release available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Medallyon/unidays-tech-placements-19-20/releases) page.
